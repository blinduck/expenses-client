# Expenses Project Client

This expense tracker allows multiple people who belong to the same household to record their personal and household expenses.
The initial motivation was to make it easier to divide household expenses with my wife.



## Tech
Standard react.js project, bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>

To try it:  
1. clone the <a href="https://github.com/blinduck/expenses-server">server repo</a> and get it up and running first.
2. clone the repo
3. run 'npm install'
4. set the base url that your server is running on in helpers.js (e.g. localhost:8000)
5. run 'npm run start'
